\section{Section example}\label{sec:Section example}

Documents usually have some levels of sections to keep its contents organized. LATEX supports this type of organization and also customization of the sectioning and numbering. The command \textcolor{blue}{\textbackslash section\{ \}} marks the beginning of a new section, inside the braces is set the title. Section numbering is automatic and can be disabled. 

The commands \textcolor{blue}{\textbackslash label} and \textcolor{blue}{\textbackslash ref\{ \}} are used for references. The \textcolor{blue}{\textbackslash label\{ \}} can be set either right before or after the \textcolor{blue}{\textbackslash section} statement. This also works on subsections and subsubsections. For example, section \ref{sec:Section example}.
