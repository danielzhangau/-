\section{Equation example} \label{sec: equation}

A inline equation is shown as $E = m\cdot c^{2}$, a display equation with number is shown as equation (\ref{eq:EMC})
\begin{equation}\label{eq:EMC}
E = m \cdot c^{2}
\end{equation}
and a display equation without number is shown as follow
\[
E=m\cdot c^{2}
\]
